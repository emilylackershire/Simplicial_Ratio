## Simpliciality

In https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-024-00458-1, the authors present three different measures of **simpliciality** that aim to compute how close a hypergraph is to being a simplicial complex.
The code to compute those measures is included in the XGI package (See https://pypi.org/project/xgi/).

In https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806, we propose a different approach where we compute how **surprisingly simplicial** a given hypergraph is when compared to a null model. To do so, we define a new measure, the **simplicial ratio**, which summarises this surprise with a single number. 
A simplicial ratio of 1 indicated that the hypergraph has the same simpliciality as the null model, while values above 1 indicate that the hypergraph is ``more simplicial'' than expected (and vice-versa for values below 1).
We define a simplicial pair of edges as two edges of different size where one edge in included in the other.
It can also be useful to look at the **simplicial matrix**, where we compute the number of **simplicial pairs** separately for every pair of edge sizes. 

The code to compute those new measure can be found in the **simplicial_ratio.py** code, and examples are given in the **simpliciality.ipynb** notebook.
